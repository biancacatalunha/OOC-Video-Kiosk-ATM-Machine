# OOC-Video-Kiosk-ATM-Machine

This project is the development of an interactive menu for a Video Kiosk think of Blockbuster Movies.
The kiosk presents a video Titles list on the screen. The customer selects the video(s) they like by entering a ‘selection’ number (integer), one video title per selection. The selected videos are removed from the Titles list and moved to a Basket list. When the video selection is complete the contents of the Basket list are processed using the Machine.class. 
Each video has a rental ‘cost’, it scans the Basket list and calculates the total for the ATM transaction.
